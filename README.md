# Program JB
This is a fork of **Program AB** â€” the reference implementation of the AIML 2.0 draft specification. AIML is a widely adopted standard for creating chat bots and mobile virtual assistants like ALICE, Mitsuku, English Tutor, The Professor, S.U.P.E.R. and many more. 

**Program AB** was developed by Richard Wallace (contact info@alicebot.org) and first released in January, 2013. Following in the tradition of naming AIML interpreters after letters of the alphabet (Program B, Program D, Program N, Program O etc.), the name "AB" is intended to suggest a fresh start with AIML 2.0. 

This project is called **JB** because it is originally developed for **J**uniper**B**ot Discord Bot, but keeps full abstraction so it can be used anywhere.
